2.1 determine the number of zeros (i.e., x-intercepts) of a quadratic function, using a variety of strategies (e.g., inspecting graphs; factoring; calculating the discriminant) 
Sample problem: Investigate, using graphing technology and algebraic techniques, the transformations that affect the number of zeros for a given quadratic function. 

2.2 determine the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function whose equation is given in the form f(x) = ax(2) + bx + c, using an algebraic method (e.g., completing the square; factoring to determine the zeros and averaging the zeros) 
Sample problem: Explain how partially factoring f(x) = 3x(2) – 6x + 5 into the form f(x) = 3x(x – 2) + 5 helps you determine the minimum of the function. 

2.3 solve problems involving quadratic functions arising from real-world applications and represented using function notation 
Sample problem: The profit, P(x), of a video company, in thousands of dollars, is given by P(x) =– 5x(2) + 550x – 5000, where x is the amount spent on advertising, in thousands of dollars. Determine the maximum profit that the company can make, and the amounts spent on advertising that will result in a profit and that will result in a profit of at least $4 000 000. 

2.4 determine, through investigation, the transformational relationship among the family of quadratic functions that have the same zeros, and determine the algebraic representation of a quadratic function, given the real roots of the corresponding quadratic equation and a point on the function 
Sample problem: Determine the equation of the quadratic function that passes through (2, 5) if the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation are 1 + [square root symbol]5 and 1 – [square root symbol]5. 

2.5 solve problems involving the intersection of a linear function and a quadratic function graphically and algebraically (e.g., determine the time when two identical cylindrical water tanks contain equal volumes of water, if one tank is being filled at a constant rate and the other is being emptied through a hole in the bottom) 
Sample problem: Determine, through investigation, the equations of the lines that have a slope of 2 and that intersect the quadratic function f(x) = x(6 – x) once; twice; never.
