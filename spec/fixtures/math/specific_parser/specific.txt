1.1 explain the meaning of the term function, and distinguish a function from a relation that is not a function, through investigation of linear and quadratic relations using a variety of representations (i.e., tables of values, mapping diagrams, graphs, function machines, equations) and strategies (e.g., identifying a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping; using the vertical-line test) 
Sample problem: Investigate, using numeric and graphical representations, whether the relation x = y2 is a function, and justify your reasoning. 

1.2 represent linear and quadratic functions using function notation, given their equations, tables of values, or graphs, and substitute into and evaluate functions [e.g., evaluate f (1/2), given f(x) = 2x2 + 3x – 1] 
 
1.3 explain the meanings of the terms domain and range, through investigation using numeric, graphical, and algebraic representations of the functions f(x) = x, f(x) = x2, f(x) = [square root symbol]x, and f(x) = 1/x; describe the domain and range of a function appropriately (e.g., for y = x2 + 1, the domain is the set of real numbers, and the range is y = 1); and explain any restrictions on the domain and range in contexts arising from real-world applications 
Sample problem: A quadratic function represents the relationship between the height of a ball and the time elapsed since the ball was thrown. What physical factors will restrict the domain and range of the quadratic function? 

1.4 relate the process of determining the inverse of a function to their understanding of reverse processes (e.g., applying inverse operations) 

1.5 determine the numeric or graphical representation of the inverse of a linear or quadratic function, given the numeric, graphical, or algebraic representation of the function, and make connections, through investigation using a variety of tools (e.g., graphing technology, Mira, tracing paper), between the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse (e.g., the graph of the inverse is the reflection of the graph of the function in the line y = x) 
Sample problem: Given a graph and a table of values representing population over time, produce a table of values for the inverse and graph the inverse on a new set of axes. 

1.6 determine, through investigation, the relationship between the domain and range of a function and the domain and range of the inverse relation, and determine whether or not the inverse relation is a function 
Sample problem: Given the graph of f(x) = x2, graph the inverse relation. Compare the domain and range of the function with the domain 
and range of the inverse relation, and investigate connections to the domain and range of the functions g(x) = [square root symbol]x and h(x) =–[square root symbol]x. 

1.7 determine, using function notation when appropriate, the algebraic representation of the inverse of a linear or quadratic function, given the algebraic representation of the function [e.g., f(x) = (x – 2)2 – 5], and make connections, through investigation using a variety of tools (e.g., graphing technology, Mira, tracing paper), between the algebraic representations of a function and its inverse (e.g., the inverse of a linear function involves applying the inverse operations in the reverse order) 
Sample problem: Given the equations of several linear functions, graph the functions and their inverses, determine the equations of the inverses, and look for patterns that connect the equation of each linear function with the equation of the inverse. 

1.8 determine, through investigation using technology, the roles of the parameters a, k, d, and c in functions of the form y = af (k(x – d)) + c, and describe these roles in terms of transformations on the graphs of f(x) = x, f(x) = x(2), f(x) = [square root symbol]x, and f(x) = 1/x (i.e., translations; reflections in the axes; vertical and horizontal stretches and compressions to and from the x- and y-axes) 
Sample problem: Investigate the graph f(x) = 3(x – d)2 + 5 for various values of d, using technology, and describe the effects of changing d in terms of a transformation. 

1.9 sketch graphs of y = af (k(x – d)) + c by applying one or more transformations to the graphs of f(x) = x, f(x) = x(2), f(x) = [square root symbol]x, and f(x) = 1/x, and state the domain and range of the transformed functions 
Sample problem: Transform the graph of f(x) to sketch g(x), and state the domain and range of each function, for the following: 
f(x) = [square root symbol]x, g(x) = [square root symbol](x – 4); f(x) = 1/x, g(x) = - 1/x + 1.
