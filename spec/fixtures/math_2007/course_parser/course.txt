Sample problem: Using data from Statistics Canada, investigate to determine if there was a period of time over which changes in the population of Canadians aged 20–24 could be modelled using a sinusoidal function. 

3.3 determine, through investigation, how sinusoidal functions can be used to model periodic phenomena that do not involve angles Sample problem: Investigate, using graphing technology in degree mode, and explain how the function h(t) = 5sin(30(t + 3)) approximately models the relationship between the height and the time of day for a tide with an amplitude of 5 m, if high tide is at midnight. 

3.4 predict the effects on a mathematical model (i.e., graph, equation) of an application involving periodic phenomena when the conditions in the application are varied (e.g., varying the conditions, such as speed and direction, when walking in a circle in front of a motion sensor) 
Sample problem: The relationship between the height above the ground of a person riding a Ferris wheel and time can be modelled using a sinusoidal function. Describe the effect on this function if the platform from which the person enters the ride is raised by 1 m and if the Ferris wheel turns twice as fast. 

3.5 pose problems based on applications involving a sinusoidal function, and solve these and other such problems by using a given graph or a graph generated with technology from a table of values or from its equation 
Sample problem: The height above the ground of a rider on a Ferris wheel can be modelled by the sinusoidal function h(t) = 25sin(3(t – 30)) + 27, where h(t) is the height, in metres, and t is the time, in seconds. Graph the function, using graphing technology in degree mode, and determine the maximum and minimum heights of the rider, the height after 30 s, and the time required to complete one revolution.
