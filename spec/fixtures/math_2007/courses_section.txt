1.2 recognize that the rate of change for a function is a comparison of changes in the dependent variable to changes in the independent variable, and distinguish situations in which the rate of change is zero, constant, or changing by examining applications, including those arising from real-world situations (e.g., rate of change of the area of a circle as the radius increases, inflation rates, the rising trend in graduation rates among Aboriginal youth, speed of a cruising aircraft, speed of a cyclist climbing a hill, infection rates)  
Sample problem: The population of bacteria in a sample is 250 000 at 1:00 p.m., 500 000 at 3:00 p.m., and 1 000 000 at 5:00 p.m. Compare methods used to calculate the change in the population and the rate of change in the population between 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Is the rate of change constant?

Sample problem: John rides his bicycle at a constant cruising speed along a flat road. He then decelerates (i.e., decreases speed) as he climbs a hill. At the top, he accelerates (i.e., increases speed) on a flat road back to his constant cruising speed, and he then accelerates down a hill. Finally, he comes to another hill and glides to a stop as he starts to climb. Sketch a graph of John's speed versus time and a graph of his distance travelled versus time.

Sample problem: Use tangents to investigate the behaviour of a function when the instantaneous rate of change is zero, positive, or negative.

2.2 recognize real-world applications of combinations of functions (e.g., the motion of a damped pendulum can be represented by a function that is the product of a trigonometric function and an exponential function; the frequencies of tones associated with the numbers on a telephone involve the addition of two trigonometric functions), and solve related problems graphically  
Sample problem: The rate at which a contaminant leaves a storm sewer and enters a lake depends on two factors: the concentration of the contaminant in the water from the sewer and the rate at which the water leaves the sewer. Both of these factors vary with time. The concentration of the contaminant, in kilograms per cubic metre of water, is given by c(t) = t(2), where t is in seconds.

2.7 demonstrate, by giving examples for functions represented in a variety of ways (e.g., function machines, graphs, equations), the property that the composition of a function and its inverse function maps a number onto itself [i.e., f(–1)(f(x)) = x and f(f(–1) (x)) = x demonstrate that the inverse function is the reverse process of the original function and that it undoes what the function does]  
 
2.8 make connections, through investigation using technology, between transformations (i.e., vertical and horizontal translations; reflections in the axes; vertical and horizontal stretches and compressions to and from the x-and y-axes) of simple functions f(x) [e.g., f(x) = x(3) + 20, f(x) = sin x, f(x) = log x] and the composition of these functions with a linear function of the form g(x) = A(x + B)  
Sample problem: Compare the graph of f(x) = x(2) with the graphs of f(g(x)) and g(f(x)), where g(x) = 2(x – d), for various values of d. Describe the effects of d in terms of transformations of f(x).

2.5 solve problems arising from real-world applications by applying a mathematical model and the concepts and procedures associated with the derivative to determine mathematical results, and interpret and communicate the results  
Sample problem: A bird is foraging for berries.

Sample problem: Of six cases, three each hold $1, two each hold $1000, and one holds $100 000. Calculate the expected value and interpret its meaning. Make a conjecture about what happens to the expected value if you add $10 000 to each case or if you multiply the amount in each case by 10. Verify your conjectures.

Sample problem: For the situation involving the rolling of two number cubes and determining the sum, identify the discrete random variable and generate the related probability histogram. Determine the total area of the bars in the histogram and explain your result.

1.6 compare, with technology and using numeric and graphical representations, the probability distributions of discrete random variables (e.g., compare binomial distributions with the same probability of success for increasing numbers of trials; compare the shapes of a hypergeometric distribution and a binomial distribution)  
Sample problem: Compare the probability distributions associated with drawing 0, 1, 2, or 3 face cards when a card is drawn 3 times from a standard deck with replacement (i.e., the card is replaced after each draw) and without replacement (i.e., the card is not replaced after each draw).

Use the probability distribution to determine the probability of at least 4 of the 10 reservations being cancelled.  
 
2. Understanding Probability Distributions for Continuous Random Variables  
 
By the end of this course, students will:   
 
2.1 recognize and identify a continuous random variable (i.e., a variable that assumes values from the infinite number of possible outcomes in a continuous sample space), and distinguish between situations that give rise to discrete frequency distributions (e.g., counting the number of outcomes for drawing a card or tossing three coins) and situations that give rise to continuous frequency distributions (e.g., measuring the time taken to complete a task or the maximum distance a ball can be thrown)  
 
2.2 recognize standard deviation as a measure of the spread of a distribution, and determine, with and without technology, the mean and standard deviation of a sample of values of a continuous random variable

2.5 recognize that theoretical probability for a continuous random variable is determined over a range of values (e.g., the probability that the life of a lightbulb is between 90 hours and 115 hours), that the probability that a continuous random variable takes any single value is zero, and that the probabilities of ranges of values form the probability distribution associated with the random variable  
 
2.6 recognize that the normal distribution is commonly used to model the frequency and probability distributions of continuous random variables, describe some properties of the normal distribution (e.g., the curve has a central peak; the curve is symmetric about the mean; the mean and median are equal; approximately 68% of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean and approximately 95% of the data values are within two standard deviations of the mean), and recognize and describe situations that can be modelled using the normal distribution (e.g., birth weights of males or of females, household incomes in a neighbourhood, baseball batting averages) 
 
2.7 make connections, through investigation using dynamic statistical software, between the normal distribution and the binomial and hypergeometric distributions for increasing numbers of trials of the discrete distributions (e.g., recognizing that the shape of the hypergeometric distribution of the number of males on a 4-person committee selected from a group of people more closely resembles the shape of a normal distribution as the size of the group from which the committee was drawn increases)  
Sample problem: Explain how the total area of a probability histogram for a binomial distribution allows you to predict the area under a normal probability distribution curve.  
 
2.8 recognize a z-score as the positive or negative number of standard deviations from the mean to a value of the continuous random variable, and solve probability problems involving normal distributions using a variety of tools and strategies (e.g., calculating a z-score and reading a probability from a table; using technology to determine a probability), including problems arising from real-world applications  
Sample problem: The heights of 16-month-old maple seedlings are normally distributed with a mean of 32 cm and a standard deviation of 10.2 cm. What is the probability that the height of a randomly selected seedling will be between 24.0 cm and 38.0 cm?

2.4 solve problems involving the areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles, and of related composite shapes, in situations arising from real-world applications  
Sample problem: A car manufacturer wants to display three of its compact models in a triangular arrangement on a rotating circular platform. Calculate a reasonable area for this platform, and explain your assumptions and reasoning.  
 
2.5 solve problems involving the volumes and surface areas of rectangular prisms, triangular prisms, and cylinders, and of related composite figures, in situations arising from real-world applications  
Sample problem: Compare the volumes of concrete needed to build three steps that are 4 ft wide and that have the cross-sections shown below. Explain your assumptions and reasoning.  (omitted graph from page 154) 
 
2.6 construct a two-dimensional scale drawing of a familiar setting (e.g., classroom, flower bed, playground) on grid paper or using design or drawing software  
Sample problem: Your family is moving to a new house with a living room that is 16 ft by 10 ft. Cut out and label simple geometric shapes, drawn to scale, to represent every piece of furniture in your present living room. Place all of your cut-outs on a scale drawing of the new living room to find out if the furniture will fit appropriately (e.g., allowing adequate space to move around).  
 
2.7 construct, with reasonable accuracy, a three-dimensional scale model of an object or environment of personal interest (e.g., appliance, room, building, garden, bridge)  
Sample problem: Design an innovative combination of two appliances or two other consumer products (e.g., a camera and a cellphone, a refrigerator and a television), and construct a three-dimensional scale model.  
 
2.8 investigate, plan, design, and prepare a budget for a household improvement (e.g., landscaping a property; renovating a room), using appropriate technologies (e.g., design or decorating websites, design or drawing software, spreadsheet)  
Sample problem: Plan, design, and prepare a budget for the renovation of a 12-ft by 12-ft bedroom for under $2000. The renovations could include repainting the walls, replacing the carpet with hardwood flooring, and refurnishing the room.  
 
3. Solving Measurement Problems Using Proportional Reasoning  
 
By the end of this course, students will:  
 
3.1 identify and describe applications of ratio and rate, and recognize and represent equivalent ratios (e.g., show that 4:6 represents the same ratio as 2:3 by showing that a ramp with a height of 4 m and a base of 6 m and a ramp with a height of 2 m and a base of 3 m are equally steep) and equivalent rates (e.g., recognize that paying $1.25 for 250 mL of tomato sauce is equivalent to paying $3.75 for 750 mL of the same sauce), using a variety of tools (e.g., concrete materials, diagrams, dynamic geometry software)  
 
3.2 identify situations in which it is useful to make comparisons using unit rates, and solve problems that involve comparisons of unit rates  
Sample problem: If 500 mL of juice costs $2.29 and 750 mL of the same juice costs $3.59, which size is the better buy? Explain your reasoning.  
 
3.3 identify and describe real-world applications of proportional reasoning (e.g., mixing concrete; calculating dosages; converting units; painting walls; calculating fuel consumption; calculating pay; enlarging patterns), distinguish between a situation involving a proportional relationship (e.g., recipes, where doubling the quantity of each ingredient doubles the number of servings; long-distance phone calls billed at a fixed cost per minute, where talking for half as many minutes costs half as much) and a situation involving a non-proportional relationship (e.g., cellular phone packages, where doubling the minutes purchased does not double the cost of the package; food purchases, where it can be less expensive to buy the same quantity of a product in one large package than in two or more small packages; hydro bills, where doubling consumption does not double the cost) in a personal and/or workplace context, and explain their reasoning  
 
3.4 identify and describe the possible consequences (e.g., overdoses of medication; seized engines; ruined clothing; cracked or crumbling concrete) of errors in proportional reasoning (e.g., not recognizing the importance of maintaining proportionality; not correctly calculating the amount of each component in a mixture)  
Sample problem: Age, gender, body mass, body chemistry, and habits such as smoking are some factors that can influence the effectiveness of a medication. For which of these factors might doctors use proportional reasoning to adjust the dosage of medication? What are some possible consequences of making the adjustments incorrectly?  
 
3.5 solve problems involving proportional reasoning in everyday life (e.g., applying fertilizers; mixing gasoline and oil for use in small engines; mixing cement; buying plants for flower beds; using pool or laundry chemicals; doubling recipes; estimating cooking time from the time needed per pound; determining the fibre content of different sizes of food servings)  
Sample problem: Bring the label from a large can of stew to class. Use the information on the label to calculate how many calories and how much fat you would consume if you ate the whole can for dinner. Then search out information on a form of exercise you could choose for burning all those calories. For what length of time would you need to exercise?  
 
3.6 solve problems involving proportional reasoning in work-related situations (e.g., calculating overtime pay; calculating pay for piecework; mixing concrete for small or large jobs)  
Sample problem: Coiled pipe from the United States is delivered in 200-ft lengths. Your company needs pipe in 3.7-m sections. How many sections can you make from each 200-ft length?
